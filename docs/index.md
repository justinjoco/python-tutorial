This tutorial is intended for developers who have had experience coding in other languages. At a later point, I will revise this to be readable for beginners. 

I will be using Python 3 and cover introductory to intermediate Python concepts, from basic syntax to object-oriented programming. This will also go over Python features that could prove useful to developers. This will neither go over popular Python modules like numpy, scipy, requests, etc, nor teach data structures and algorithms fundamentals.

## What is Python?

Who are you talking to right now? Who is it that you think you see? Do you know how much I make a year? I mean, even if I tell you, you wouldn’t believe it. Do you know what happens if I suddenly decide to stop going into work? A business big enough it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly-up. Gone. It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don’t know who you’re talking to so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skylar. I am the danger. A guy opens his front door and gets shot, and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks.
