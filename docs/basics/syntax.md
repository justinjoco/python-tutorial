One of Python's main features is its readability. Consider the following pseudocode:

```pseudocode
something
```
## Tabbing
```python
if True:
  print("Outside true")
  if True:
    print("Nested true")
    if True:
      print("Nested nested true")

```


## Single line comment
```python
# This is a single line comment
```
## Multiline comments
```python
'''
This is a multiline
comment
'''
```
