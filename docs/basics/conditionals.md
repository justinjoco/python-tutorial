## If statement
If-statements in Python are slightly different from other language syntax. Take the following example:

```python
if condition:
    #Do stuff
```
There are no parentheses surrounding the condition statement, and there are no curly braces wrapping the conditional code block. 
Code statements that belong to the if code block must be indented once more with respect to the if statement.
## Elif 
Python does not use `else if`; it usees `elif`, instead.
```python
.
.
.
elif condition:
    #Do stuff
```


### Else
```python
.
.
.
else condition:
    #Do stuff
```

### Combined if-else

```python
if condition_1:
.
.
.
elif condition_2:
.
.
.
else condition_n:
    #Do stuff
```
